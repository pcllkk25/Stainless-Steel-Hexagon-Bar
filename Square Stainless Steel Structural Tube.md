## Material Composition

Our Square Stainless Steel Structural Tubes are manufactured using top-tier stainless steel alloys, primarily composed of chromium and nickel. The chromium content forms a passive layer on the surface, preventing rust and corrosion. This makes them highly suitable for environments where traditional steel would degrade rapidly. Additionally, the inclusion of nickel enhances their ductility and toughness, ensuring they can withstand significant stress without deformation.

- **Chromium**: 18% minimum
- **Nickel**: 8% minimum
- **Carbon**: Low carbon content ensures minimal brittleness

These materials ensure that the tubes retain their properties under harsh conditions, making them a reliable choice for long-term projects.
