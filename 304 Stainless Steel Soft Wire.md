## What is 304 Stainless Steel Soft Wire?

The 304 Stainless Steel Soft Wire is crafted from premium-grade stainless steel with a composition of approximately 18% chromium and 8% nickel. This alloy provides exceptional resistance to corrosion, making it ideal for environments where exposure to moisture, chemicals, or other corrosive substances is common. The "soft" designation refers to its malleability, allowing it to be easily bent, shaped, or manipulated without losing its structural integrity.

Our soft wire is designed to meet international standards such as ASTM A557 and ISO 3547, ensuring consistent quality and performance across all batches. It is widely used in applications ranging from industrial fasteners to decorative elements due to its aesthetic appeal and robustness.

## Key Features and Benefits

- **Corrosion Resistance**: The inclusion of chromium and nickel ensures long-lasting durability, protecting the wire from rusting and degradation over time.
