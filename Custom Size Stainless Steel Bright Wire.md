## Material Composition

The stainless steel used in our bright wire is composed of several key elements that contribute to its exceptional properties:

| Element       | Percentage Range |
|---------------|------------------|
| Chromium      | 17%-20%          |
| Nickel         | 8%-10%           |
| Carbon         | 0.08% max        |
| Manganese     | 2% max           |
| Silicon       | 1% max           |

These elements work together to create a material that is resistant to rust, corrosion, and wear. The chromium content provides a passive layer on the surface, which prevents oxidation, while the nickel enhances toughness and ductility.
