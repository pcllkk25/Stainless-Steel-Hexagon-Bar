## Material Composition

The Strong Magnetic Stainless Steel Bright Wire is composed of a high-grade stainless steel alloy, primarily featuring chromium and nickel, which contribute to its magnetic properties and corrosion resistance. Here’s a breakdown of the typical composition:

| **Element** | **Percentage Range** |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Chromium    | 16%-18%             |
| Nickel       | 8%-10%              |
| Carbon       | ≤0.08%              |
| Manganese   | ≤2%                 |
| Silicon     | ≤1%                 |

This precise composition ensures that the wire retains its magnetic properties even under demanding conditions, making it suitable for long-term use in harsh environments.
