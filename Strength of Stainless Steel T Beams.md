## Material Composition

The core material of our Stainless Steel T Beams is austenitic stainless steel, which is known for its excellent mechanical properties. This type of stainless steel contains chromium, nickel, and molybdenum, which contribute to its outstanding resistance to corrosion and oxidation. The composition ensures that the beams maintain their integrity even under harsh environmental conditions, such as exposure to moisture, chemicals, or extreme temperatures.

Here’s a breakdown of the typical chemical composition of our Stainless Steel T Beams:

| **Element**   | **Percentage Range** |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Chromium       | 17 - 20%            |
| Nickel          | 8 - 12%             |
| Carbon          | ≤ 0.08%             |
| Manganese       | ≤ 2%                |
| Silicon         | ≤ 1%                |

This precise composition not only enhances the strength of the beams but also ensures their longevity and performance over time.
