## FAQs

**Q: What is the difference between 304 and 316 stainless steel?**
A: 316 stainless steel contains molybdenum, which provides better corrosion resistance, especially in chloride environments. It is often used in marine and chemical applications.

**Q: How do I choose the right thickness for my project?**
A: The choice depends on the specific application. Thicker coils are more durable and can withstand higher loads, while thinner coils are easier to form and shape.

**Q: Can I get custom sizes?**
A: Yes, we offer custom sizes to meet your specific project requirements. Please contact us for further details.
