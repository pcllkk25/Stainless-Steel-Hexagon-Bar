## Material Composition

The Acid Resistant Stainless Steel Round Bars are made from premium-grade stainless steel alloys, primarily containing chromium, nickel, and molybdenum. These elements work together to enhance the material's corrosion resistance and mechanical properties:

- **Chromium**: Provides excellent oxidation resistance and enhances the material's ability to form a passive layer.
- **Nickel**: Improves toughness and ductility, making the material more resilient under stress.
- **Molybdenum**: Boosts pitting and crevice corrosion resistance, particularly in acidic environments.

This combination ensures that our round bars can endure prolonged exposure to acidic substances without significant degradation.
