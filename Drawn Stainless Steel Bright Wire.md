At SD-Steel, we pride ourselves on offering high-quality materials that cater to a wide range of industries. Our Drawn Stainless Steel Bright Wire is one such product that has been crafted with precision and excellence in mind. This wire is designed to meet the stringent demands of various applications where durability, corrosion resistance, and strength are paramount.

## Product Description

Drawn Stainless Steel Bright Wire is a versatile material that combines the inherent properties of stainless steel with the added benefits of being drawn into fine wires. The drawing process enhances its surface finish, making it smoother and more uniform than standard stainless steel wires. This makes it an ideal choice for applications requiring high precision and minimal friction. Whether you're working on automotive parts, medical devices, or precision instruments, our Drawn Stainless Steel Bright Wire offers the reliability and performance you need.

## Material Properties

The primary material used in our Drawn Stainless Steel Bright Wire is AISI 304 stainless steel, known for its excellent corrosion resistance and mechanical properties. Additionally, we offer variations in other grades such as AISI 316, which provides enhanced resistance to pitting and crevice corrosion. These materials are carefully selected and processed to ensure they meet international standards like ASTM A313 and ISO 9001.

| Grade        | Composition (%)   | Applications                       |
