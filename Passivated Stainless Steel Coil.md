# Passivated Stainless Steel Coil

Welcome to SD-Steel, your trusted partner in high-quality stainless steel products! We are pleased to offer our premium Passivated Stainless Steel Coil, designed to meet the highest standards of durability and performance.

## Product Description

Passivated Stainless Steel Coil is a superior grade of stainless steel that has undergone a chemical treatment process known as passivation. This process enhances the natural corrosion resistance properties of the steel, making it ideal for applications where long-lasting performance and aesthetic appeal are critical. Our coils are available in various grades, including 304, 316, and 430, ensuring versatility for a wide range of industries.

## Material Specifications

| Grade | Composition (%) | Hardness (HV) | Density (g/cm³) |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 304   | C ≤ 0.15, Mn ≤ 2, Si ≤ 1, Cr 18-20, Ni 8-10.5 | 187 | 7.93 |
| 316   | C ≤ 0.08, Mn ≤ 2, Si ≤ 1, Cr 16-18, Ni 10-14, Mo 2-3 | 150 | 8.02 |
| 430   | C ≤ 0.15, Mn ≤ 1.5, Si ≤ 1, Cr 16-18, Ni ≤ 0.75 | 187 | 7.70 |
