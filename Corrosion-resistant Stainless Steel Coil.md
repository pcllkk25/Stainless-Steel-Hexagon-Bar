**FAQs:**

**Q1: What is the difference between 304 and 304L grade stainless steel?**
A1: The primary difference lies in the carbon content. 304L has a lower carbon content which reduces the risk of intergranular corrosion, making it ideal for applications requiring higher corrosion resistance.

**Q2: Can these coils be customized in terms of length and width?**
A2: Yes, we offer customizable lengths and widths to meet specific project requirements. Please contact us with your exact dimensions for a quote.

**Q3: How do I maintain the finish of the stainless steel coil?**
A3: Regular cleaning with mild detergent and water is sufficient. Avoid abrasive materials that can scratch the surface.
